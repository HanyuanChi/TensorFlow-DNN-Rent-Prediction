# TensorFlow-DNN-Rent-Prediction
This repository has two files/models: 1. model without state information  2. model with state information
## 1.Model without state information
2 hidden layers with 30 nodes each.
For each hidden layer, the activation function is RELU.
Learning rate = 0.01, steps(iterations) = 5000.
MAPE = 13.7%, which means the accuracy is 86.3%.
Optimization algorithm: Adam.
## 2.Model with state information
2 hidden layers with 30 nodes each.
For each hidden layer, the activation function is RELU.
Learning rate = 0.005, steps(iterations) = 10000.
MAPE = 13.3%, which means the accuracy is 86.7%.
Optimization algorithm: Adam.
